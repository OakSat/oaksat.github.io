# Alon Shabat – Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  
Feel free to explore, learn from it, or borrow parts for your own site.

## ✨ What’s Here

- A simple, fast, and human-centered personal site
- Project highlights and personal blog content (coming soon!)
- Clean and responsive layout
- Some quirky disclaimers (you’ve been warned)

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

If you're just curious about how it works:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
No build process or fancy setup required, unless your'e using a GUIless machine.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- HTML + CSS + JS
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## 🙏 A Small Request

Feel free to use parts of this code in your own projects, just please don’t copy my analytics tags.  
It’ll mess up my metrics, and we'll both feel weird about it.
