            <h2>"Ethical Demos" Project - Teaching Demos</h2>

            <p>
                As a student mentor, I’ve had the chance to guide curious young minds into the world of cybersecurity —
                helping them grasp key concepts, real-world scenarios, and essential industry terminology.
                <br /><br />
                The demos below are hands-on simulations of common cyber attacks, created strictly for educational use.
                <br />Each one follows ethical guidelines and aims to make security concepts more accessible and
                engaging.
